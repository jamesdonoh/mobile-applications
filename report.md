## Introduction

This is my report for the Mobile Applications MSc.

There are a number of Android design principles [@androiddesign] we should follow.

## Case study

As the mobile application sector continues to grow (ref?), vendors are looking for new features and approaches that will help them stick out in a crowded marketplace. This case study will focus on one business sector, fast food, and identify some requirements for a new mobile application, with reference to business trends and existing applications.

### Background

The fast food industry is worth approximately GBPXXbn in the United Kingdom alone and continues to evolve.

More recently the 'fast-casual' restaurants, without table service but with a better quality of food than traditional fast food outlets, has begun to spread outside the US and is expected to have a significant impact on the UK market [@henkes].
